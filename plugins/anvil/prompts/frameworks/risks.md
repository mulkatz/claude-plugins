# Framework: Risk Register

**OVERRIDE the default Synthesizer output format.** Use the risk register format below instead.

Distill the debate into a pure risk assessment. Every unresolved concern is a risk. Every dismantled
argument is a risk that was evaluated and dismissed. Every surviving argument informs the likelihood
and impact ratings.

## Output Format

### Subject

[What is being risk-assessed — 1 sentence]

### Executive Summary

[2-3 sentences: overall risk level and the single biggest concern]

### Risk Register

| #   | Risk    | Category                                        | Likelihood   | Impact       | Risk Level               | Status |
| --- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------ | ------------ | ------------------------ | ------ |
| R1  | [Title] | [Technical/Business/Operational/Legal/Security] | High/Med/Low | High/Med/Low | Critical/High/Medium/Low | Open   |
| R2  | ...     | ...                                             | ...          | ...          | ...                      | ...    |

### Risk Details

**R1: [Title]**

- **Description**: [What could go wrong]
- **Source**: [Which debate argument surfaced this risk]
- **Survived critique?**: [Yes/No — was this risk challenged and did it hold up?]
- **Likelihood rationale**: [Why this likelihood rating]
- **Impact rationale**: [What happens if this risk materializes]
- **Mitigation strategy**: [Specific actions to reduce likelihood or impact]
- **Risk owner**: [Who should own this risk — role, not name]
- **Residual risk after mitigation**: [High/Med/Low]

[Repeat for each risk]

### Dismissed Risks

[Risks that were raised during the debate but successfully dismantled — listed here for
transparency] | Risk | Raised by | Dismissed because | |------|-----------|-------------------| |
[Title] | Advocate/Critic | [Why it was dismissed] |

### Risk Interactions

[Risks that compound each other — if R1 AND R3 materialize together, the impact is worse than either
alone]

### Overall Assessment

**Aggregate risk level**: [Critical / High / Medium / Low / Acceptable] **Go/No-go recommendation**:
[Proceed / Proceed with mitigations / Delay until mitigated / Do not proceed] **Confidence in
assessment**: [high | medium | low] **Key assumption**: [The single biggest assumption underlying
this assessment]
